version control software: a code management system that allows us to keep track of changes made to large projects, which also includes backups and blame systems.


repository: folder(your project) where we store all our code/project files.


clone: to make a copy of the repository onto your system


commit: to finalize changes done to the repository and record them into the tracking system (git)


push: like uploading. We upload/push commits to the server(github).


pull: like downloading. We download/pull commits from the server. (WARNING: Keep in mind that when you pull, you may lose your work if it has not already been committed)


conflict: when two people worked on the same file. This needs to be resolved with a Merge commit.


origin: the root server that trackers your repository (a repository may be in multiple servers)


branch: a copy of the entire repository, usually meant to be changed by some collaborators


main/master: a special branch, usually NOT meant to be committed to by collaborators. It should contain finished work, and be compilable (because its meant for everyone, not just programmers of the project)


pull request: a request to merge a branch with another branch(usually main). Only compilable/finished work on your branch should be merged with main.


fork:
